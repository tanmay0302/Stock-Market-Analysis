📈 Stock Market Analysis & Forecasting
```
This project presents a complete end-to-end stock market analysis and prediction system using Python. It includes data preprocessing, feature engineering, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and machine learning modeling using Random Forest to forecast future closing prices.
```
🚀 Project Objectives
```
Analyze historical stock data of AAPL, MSFT, GOOG, NFLX

Visualize stock trends and distributions

Engineer features (lags, returns) for ML modeling

Predict next-day stock prices using regression models

Evaluate and tune models for better performance
```
📁 Dataset
```

The dataset contains historical stock prices with the following columns:

Date

Open, High, Low, Close, Volume

Ticker (stock symbol)
```
📊 Workflow Overview
```
1. Define Scope
Forecast daily closing prices for major tech companies.

2. Data Collection
Historical data (loaded from CSV file).

3. Data Preparation
Convert date, handle missing values, sort data.

4. EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis)
Visualizations for price trends and comparisons.

Boxplots and line charts for price distribution.

5. Feature Engineering
Create lag features (Lag_1, Lag_2)

Calculate Daily Return

Add Target as next day’s closing price

6. Model Selection
Used Random Forest Regressor as the primary model.

7. Model Training & Evaluation
Trained with train_test_split

Evaluated using MSE and R² Score

8. Model Tuning
Performed 5-fold cross-validation.

9. Deployment
Prepared for deployment with prediction on new input data.
```
🛠 Technologies Used
```

✅ Future Improvements
```
Add live data fetching using **yfinance** or **pandas_datareader**

Try LSTM/GRU deep learning models for sequential prediction

Build interactive dashboards (Streamlit or Plotly)

Deploy via Flask API or Streamlit app
